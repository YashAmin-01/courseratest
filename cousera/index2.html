                <h2>CHICKEN</h2>
                <P>
                    Chicken generally includes low fat in the meat itself (castrated roosters excluded). 
                    The fat is highly concentrated on the skin. A 100g serving of baked chicken breast 
                    contains 4 grams of fat and 31 grams of protein, compared to 10 grams of fat and 27 grams 
                    of protein for the same portion of broiled, lean skirt steak.
                </P>

                    <p>
                        Beef, flesh of mature cattle, as distinguished from veal, the flesh of calves. 
                        The best beef is obtained from early maturing, special beef breeds. High-quality beef has 
                        firm, velvety, fine-grained lean, bright red in colour and well-marbled. The fat is smooth, 
                        creamy white, and well distributed.

                        <h2>SUSHI</h2>
                        <p>
                            Sushi is a popular Japanese dish made from seasoned rice with fish, egg, or vegetables. 
                   Sushi comes from a Japanese word meaning "sour rice," and it's the rice that's at the 
                   heart of sushi, even though most Americans think of it as raw fish. In fact, it's the word 
                   sashimi that refers to a piece of raw fish.
